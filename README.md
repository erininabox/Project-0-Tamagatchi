    - Each message should give a clear idea what you changed.
- [ ] Include Wireframes and User Stories in the README
- [ ] Render a game in the browser
- [ ] Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- [ ] Use JavaScript or jQuery for DOM manipulation (no Canvas)
- [ ] Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

## Necessary Deliverables

- [ ] A working MVP (minium viable product) 
    - what is the absolute bare minimum functionality for you game, do not make it more complex until you've completed your MVP.
    - Define what this will look like
- [ ] A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
- [ ] A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
- [ ] A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- [ ] A README.md file with an explanation of what the project is, your user stories, explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, the other components previously indicated (if applicable). In this project, also include your wireframes in the readme.
- [ ] A 10 minute presentation to your classmates and instructor, illustrating:
    - App functionality
    - Triumphs
    - Challenges
    - Words of Wisdom
    - Code snippets

## User Stories:

### Story 1:
- User clicks 'Adopt A Pet'
- Options for species of pets appears: Dogs, Cats, Other
- User chooses a species
- Options for their chosen species (different breeds/colors/species)
- User chooses their pet
- Prompt for pet name appears
    - Can the user go back through this process? would need functionality for overwriting whatever they chose before, if so
- User names the pet
    - Optional for later: Name generator
- Screen changes to show their pet with their new name in their home
    - Screen contains displays for Age, Hunger, Sleepiness, and Boredom (will revisit precise functionality for this later)
    - Screen also contains buttons for Feed, Turn Off Lights, and Play. These affect the Hunger, Sleepiness, and Boredom categories
- User clicks on Feed, Turn Off Lights, and Play, changing the meters appropriately. Or the player doesn't, and is a neglectful user who should be scolded.
- Play ends with pet death.
    - If Pet reaches X Age, pet dies a peaceful death of old age
    - If Pet reaches 10/10 on any of their other meters, pet dies from neglect and user is scolded


## Technologies Used
* HTML5 + Semantic HTML
* CSS (will likely use a combo of flexbox and grid)
* JS (vanilla)
* Images from Adobe Stock

## Approach taken
1. Wrote User Story 1
2. Whiteboard out the functionality
3. Create wireframe
4. Create basic HTML structure
5. Create CSS & JS files/folders, link them to HTML
6. Upload images
7. Get MVP logic written in JS
8. Go back and apply basic style elements (e.g. images) to page
9. Iterate as needed to add extras
